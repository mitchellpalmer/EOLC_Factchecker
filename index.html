                            The End of Life Choice Act has already been passed by Parliament and will come into force if
                            a majority of New Zealanders vote for it at the referendum. It was debated in Parliament for
                            nearly two years, one of the longest processes in the history of Parliament. Parliament put
                            numerous safeguards into the bill, which overseas experience shows are effective in keeping
                            individuals safe from coercion.

                                The doctor must be intimately familiar with the patient's circumstances. The Act
                                requires they

                                prognosis,
                                options and intentions. They must consult with other professionals involved in the

                                care and seek to talk with their family.

                            The Ministry of Health advises that the shortest period possible from an initial application
                            to
                            the assisted death is around three weeks. Given the number of safeguards and consultations
                            involved,
                            this is probably a fast estimate. International experience shows arbitrary delay periods do
                            not make
                            the law safer, but some people die badly waiting for the period to end.

                            <p>The law requires doctors to <u>encourage</u> patients to talk to others, including their
                                family
                                and friends. The only times when this is likely to not happen is when the patient has no
                                family to
                                speak to or there are good reasons not to involve them. In Oregon, where a similar law
                                has been in
                                place for more than 20 years, less than 5% of patients have chosen not to inform their

                            <p>Yes. The law specifically requires an <u>independent</u> medical practitioner selected
                                by the Ministry of Health to examine the patient. They must determine that the person
                                themselves believes assisted dying is the right choice. If this doctor or the patient's
                                own doctor are unsure about whether the patient is capable of making a free and informed
                                decision, they must consult a psychiatrist.</p>
